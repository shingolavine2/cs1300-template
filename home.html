	    	<h1>Observations</h1>
	    	Users either seemed to ignore all other buttons and only use the start button or they would try to match their food with the icons displayed. They weren’t ever really confused about what the microwave did, but didn’t want to put the effort into learning all the other buttons on the microwave and wanted to just heat up their food (usually food and not drink) as quickly and easily as possible without effort. The users were occasionally frustrated with the interface, but ultimately found their own ways of making the microwave do what they want it to do.

    			1. Universal answer seemed to be “how do I heat up food” usually without thinking about it too much
    		</li>
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			2. Users varied on their answers, but they usually felt hungry and impatient and sometimes wondered about how long their food would take to heat up
    		</li>
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			3. Universally users said that they were hungry and wanted to eat food and the only thing they wanted to do with the microwave was heat up food
    		</li>
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			4. Users varied on their answers with this question. Some users would mash the start button to add 30s to the timer while others would try to press a single button that they thought would best work to heat up the food. With the exception of start button mashers, users usually wanted to avoid as many button presses as possible.

    	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4 question-summaries">
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			5. The users who pressed one button would praise the interface in that they felt it accommodated their need to press just one button. The start button mashers, however, felt that the interface was confusing and didn’t like the express cook functionality so they instead resorted to using the one button that worked the way they liked. 
    		</li>
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			6. Start button mashers didn’t ever see any unexpected behavior because they learned what the behavior of the one button they used was. Users who liked to use a single button, however, enjoyed the sometimes unexpected results and enjoyed experimenting with a new button. 
    		</li>

    	<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4 question-summaries">
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			7. Users usually aren’t confused with what the device is doing, but occasionally confused with what the buttons do. One user gave the example of the potato button and was confused what the potato button does differently than some of the other buttons
    		</li>
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			8. Start button mashers typically asked for features that made the microwave have more flexibility around the amount of time that things could be heated up for while the button selectors asked for buttons around the food that they ate more often. One user noted a ramen button would be nicer than the potato button
    		</li>
    		<li class="list-group-item bg-light">
    			9. Users didn’t have much to add other than noting that the “clock was dumb” and wished the clock just set itself instead of being confusing to set yourself

	    	<h1>Set Start Sam</h1>
	    	Set Start Sam only uses the start button which starts the microwave with 30 seconds and adds 30 seconds if the microwave is already running. These users are confused about the interface and what all the different buttons do but are able to use a single button to accomplish their goal. The interface is too complicated or confusing for these users. These were the most common among interviewees who said they wanted to devote as little thought as possible to how they heat up their food and commented that they only use the start button.

	    	<h1>Food Finder Freddie</h1>
	    	Food Finder Freddie likes to minimize button presses and match their food to the settings on the microwave. Food Finder Freddie likes to take advantage of the features that the microwave has, but is occasionally confused by what the different settings actually do. These users usually feel constrained by the interface since the food selection is very limited and will sometimes resort to using express cook. They try to approximate their intentions to match a single button on the interface. Interviewed users fit this persona when they mention that they want to try to minimize button presses and would often wonder if their food was closer to potato or frozen dinner.
